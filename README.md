# ipm-ecg-analysis

This is an Java based open source electrocardiograph(ECG) analysis software. This project is imported project home from [Google Code](), approved by its GPL v2 lisence.

## Features

This repository is unfinished. Feture plan is below.

## TO-DOs

1. Add the latest open source code by J. Oster into this repo.
2. Edit the README (and Wiki) page to add instrctions to run and contribute.

## Reference

The algorithm here, designed to detect the QRS complexes in the electrocardiogram, was first described by Nygårds and Sörnmo in 1983 in:

- Nygårds M. E. and Sörnmo L., Delineation of the QRS complex using the envelope of the ECG, Med. & Biol. Eng. & Comput. 21:538-547, 1983

and subsequently modified by Hamilton, Pan and Tompkins in 1985 and 1986 in:

- Pan J and Tompkins WJ. A Real-Time QRS Detection Algorithm. IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 32(3):230-236, 1985.

- Hamilton P. S. and Tompkins W. J. , Quantitative investigation of QRS detection rules using the MIT/BIH arrhythmia database, IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., 33(12):1157-1165, 1986.

The algorithm posted here was originally written from scratch in C by G. D. Clifford and includes updated from the citations above. which are described in:

- Clifford G.D., Signal Processing Methods for Heart Rate Variability, DPhil. Thesis, Oxford University, Michaelmas 2002. Please cite this when using the code.

Please cite this latter publication when using this code.

Translation into Java with minor modifications was performed by J. Oster.
